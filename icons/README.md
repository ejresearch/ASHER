# ASHER App Icons

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create two app icons:

## Required Icons:
- **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
- **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## How to Create Icons:

### Option 1: Use an Icon Generator (Easiest)
1. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload any square logo or design for ASHER
3. Download the generated icons
4. Place `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` in this folder

### Option 2: Create Manually
1. Design a square icon (512x512 recommended)
2. Suggested design:
   - Text "ASHER" in bold font
   - Background: Dark (#1a1a1a) or Blue (#007aff)
   - Simple, recognizable design
3. Export as PNG:
   - Save as `icon-512.png` (512x512)
   - Resize and save as `icon-192.png` (192x192)

### Option 3: Use Placeholder Icons
For testing, you can use simple colored squares:
- Any 192x192 and 512x512 PNG files will work
- Even a screenshot resized will work temporarily

## Icon Guidelines:
- Square shape (equal width and height)
- Transparent or solid background
- Clear, simple design
- Avoid fine details (looks small on phone)
- Test how it looks on both light and dark backgrounds

Once you add these icons, ASHER will display properly when installed on iPhone/iPad home screens.
